# ‚ùì Random Qs

If you just wanna play: ‚û°Ô∏è [Random Questions](https://random-qs-a7hvvzhmna-ew.a.run.app/)

You have a team gathering, either in person or online, and you want to have a lighthearted session where every team member can be involved (potentially, it really is random).

Playing <em>Random Questions</em> has been a tradition for us at The Talent Company for a long time. Now you can play too.

## Why though?

Investing in HR Tech is an integral part of our history at The Talent Company. AlexisHR was the first investment of ours that made it all the way.

This small application was open sourced as a farewell gift when AlexisHR was bought by Simployer. It uses the [AlexisHR API](https://docs.alexishr.com/) to get team member names.

## üíª Run locally

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## üöÄ Going to prod

There's a Dockerfile in the repo. That should hopefully be enough to get you going.
